# MBPCA-SHM

The uncertainty of environmental hazards attributed to climate change poses an imminent
threat to the longevity and lifespan of critical infrastructure components<sup>2,7,11</sup>. Structural Health
Monitoring (SHM) is the process by which a continuous, real-time mechanism is employed for
use in damage identification of structural components. SHM often involves the instrumentation
of structural elements with a dense, and distributed network of sensors from which the condition
of such elements may be monitored in real-time. Other monitoring schemes may necessitate an
analytical approach and are facilitated in combination with finite element models. However,
existing techniques prescribed through SHM may lack the capability to cope with anomalous
changes in the conditions under which critical infrastructure components are monitored2,7,11
